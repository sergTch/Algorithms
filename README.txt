This project is made for saving time on contests by using
prepared data structures and different algorithms

You write your code in .\Algorithms\Algorithms.cpp including other headers

After solving problem you may need to combine code into one file
So you can run main.py in ./Algorithms/build_one_file and receive solution.cpp

File .\Algorithms\Algorithms.cpp can be changed but should not be uploaded to git, so use
git update-index --assume-unchanged .\Algorithms\Algorithms.cpp
before pushing any changes
